Coding takes time..

There is a time to push it out nonstop.
Then there is a time to break and recharge.

Altogether it is a part of the coding process.

let break = 'chillout';

That means I will have to code sooner than later

<>Make time to make the skeleton<>
#time{
to add the skin
}
let time = brain;
let skeleton = 'HTML";
let skin = 'CSS';

if(skeleton || skin = 'true'){
  console.log(time);
};

Practice makes perfect
